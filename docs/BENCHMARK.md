# Benchmark

How Sepia decides which device runs each pipeline stage, and the numbers so far. The results are also the project's secondary output ([OVERVIEW.md](OVERVIEW.md#goal)).

## Harness

The benchmark is a mode of sepiad itself, so the numbers describe the pipeline users actually run:

```bash
sepiad --infer NPU --post cpu --bench 60   # run 60 s, append one row to bench.csv
```

**Baselines** (without these the numbers mean nothing):

1. Idle, camera off
2. Camera streaming, no effects (the cost of capture and MJPEG decode alone)
3. Meet in Chrome, real camera, Meet's blur on (the bar to beat), compared with Meet using Sepia Cam with Meet's blur off

**Matrix:** inference on {CPU, GPU, NPU} × blur and blend on {CPU, iGPU}: 6 configurations.

## Metrics and how they're measured on this laptop

| Metric | Source | Root? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Whole-system power | `/sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/power_now`, sampled at 1 Hz, on battery | No |
| CPU package power | RAPL through `sudo turbostat --show PkgWatt --interval 1` | Yes |
| NPU utilisation | Change in `/sys/class/accel/accel0/device/npu_busy_time_us` over the run | No |
| Time per stage | `time.perf_counter()` around each step | No |
| fps and latency (mean, p95) | Capture and send timestamps | No |
| sepiad CPU % | `/proc/self/stat` | No |

The NPU-utilisation counter also proves the NPU is doing the inference when it is selected.

## Method

On battery, screen brightness and Wi-Fi state fixed, nothing else running; each configuration runs 60 s, 3 times; report mean ± standard deviation, with the idle baseline subtracted from power. Raw CSV and the method are published with the README.

## Results

### Model only (Oct 21, 2026)

`selfie_multiclass_256x256.tflite`, 200 inferences per device on random input, OpenVINO 2025.1, `intel-npu-driver` 1.16.0 (power state not recorded):

| Device | Compile | Inference per frame | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NPU | 2.3 s | 8.7 ms | NPU busy time rose 1636 ms over the 200 runs, so the NPU did the work |
| iGPU | 1.5 s | 7.2 ms | |
| CPU | 0.2 s | 52 ms | Too slow for 30 fps |

All three gave identical per-pixel classes (on random input; to be repeated on real frames). The full pipeline, power and baselines are still to run.
